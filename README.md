![Workout Challenge Preview](./preview.png)
This is my first GitHub project. A small but functional workout challenge app. The core features fucntion as they should, though the app is still a work in progress. Super proud to share this as my first public project here on GitHub!
Please note that i'm still pretty new to programming which might leave some of you all shaking with your head when looking at my code, i look forward to improve my skills and ability to code so be sure to inform me about any code crimes i've comitted!
What i learned:
- forEach and querySelector
- using setIntervals 
- first used localStorage
